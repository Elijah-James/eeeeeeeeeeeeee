            About the Developers
        </section>
        <section class="page2info1">
            PONOS Corporation is a fairly well-known independent video game company which was formed or started 
            during the year 1990. It’s headquarters or main office is situated in Kyoto, Japan. The corporation 
            began as an image processing company but began developing games on mobile platforms later on. PONOS 
            is famous for creating the well-received tower defense game The Battle Cats, which is the focus of 
            my website. <br><br>
            Recently, PONOS even became the partner of the Williams F1 team during the 2020 Formula One World 
            Championship and the 2021 Formula One World Championship.

            About the Game (Is it Free-To-Play or Not?)
        </section>
        <section class="page2info2">
            The Battle Cats, in its core, is a free-to-play tower defense game wherein you send out cats to both 
            defend your base and destroy the enemy's base. You can obviously spend money to speed up your 
            progress in the game by buying premium currency and using said currency to draw in the game's gacha 
            system. However, it is not at all needed since a lot of people (including me) have made so much
            progress in the game without purchasing anything using real money. In short, playing the game costs
            you absolutely nothing, so why not join the community of over 40 million players.
